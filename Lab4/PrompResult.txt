You're looking for foods that are lower in Leucine (Leu), Serine (Ser), and Valine (Val), the top three amino acids found in SARS-CoV-2 (based on your list). These amino acids are part of the essential amino acid group, and they play key roles in various functions in the body, but if you're looking to minimize their intake for any reason, here are foods that tend to have lower amounts of these amino acids.

Foods Low in Leucine, Serine, and Valine:
1. Fruits

Apples: They are low in protein overall, and therefore low in these specific amino acids.

Berries (Strawberries, Raspberries, Blueberries): Low in protein and amino acids.

Citrus Fruits (Oranges, Lemons, Grapefruits): These are primarily made up of carbohydrates, with very little protein content.

Watermelon: Another low-protein fruit.

2. Vegetables

Leafy Greens (Lettuce, Spinach, Kale): These are low in protein and amino acids, but still provide fiber and essential micronutrients.

Cucumbers: Very low in protein.

Zucchini: A low-protein vegetable that can be added to many dishes.

Bell Peppers: While nutritious, they are low in protein.

3. Rice and Other Grains

White Rice: Low in protein compared to other grains.

Corn: Low in protein and generally contains lower amounts of the three amino acids you're avoiding.

Quinoa: Although it has some protein, it’s lower in these specific amino acids compared to animal-based proteins.

4. Non-Dairy Alternatives

Almond Milk: It contains little to no protein compared to cow's milk.

Rice Milk: Very low in protein content.

Coconut Milk: Another non-dairy option that is low in protein.

5. Non-Protein Snacks

Popcorn: Whole grain popcorn is a light snack that’s low in protein.

Chips made from corn or potatoes: While higher in carbs and fats, they are lower in amino acids, especially compared to protein-rich snacks.

Crackers: Many types of crackers made with white flour are low in protein and, therefore, lower in amino acids.

6. Legumes (in moderation)

Lentils: While they contain protein, lentils are relatively low in Leucine, Valine, and Serine compared to other legumes like soybeans or chickpeas.

Green Beans: These have lower protein content compared to other legumes, making them a good choice.

7. Nuts and Seeds (lower in protein)

Macadamia Nuts: They have lower protein content than most other nuts and seeds.

Cashews: While not as low as macadamias, they still contain less protein compared to almonds or walnuts.

8. Oils and Fats

Olive Oil: Pure fats like olive oil contain no amino acids.

Coconut Oil: Like olive oil, it is free of amino acids.

Butter (in moderation): Low in protein compared to other animal-based fats like lard or fatty meats.

9. Non-Protein-rich Processed Foods

Gelatin: Typically made from collagen and very low in amino acids, especially essential amino acids.

Sugar: Pure sugar has no protein content, thus no amino acids.

Example of a Low-Amino Acid Meal:

Breakfast: A bowl of citrus fruit (like orange slices) with a handful of blueberries and a splash of almond milk.

Lunch: A large salad with spinach, cucumbers, bell peppers, topped with a light drizzle of olive oil and a sprinkle of flaxseeds.

Snack: A handful of macadamia nuts or some air-popped popcorn.

Dinner: A simple dish of white rice with steamed zucchini and a side of green beans.

Key Points:

Fruits and vegetables are great staples since they have minimal protein content and very little of the targeted amino acids.

Focus on non-dairy milk alternatives, low-protein grains, and healthy oils to keep amino acid intake low.

Legumes like lentils and low-protein nuts like macadamia and cashews can also be part of the diet if you want to stay low in these specific amino acids.
