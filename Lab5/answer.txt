The main problem with this algorithm is that it uses a greedy overlap-based approach, which is not robust enough for reconstructing the original DNA sequence. Because DNA often contains repetitive regions and the samples are taken randomly, many fragments will share similar overlaps, making it easy for the algorithm to join pieces incorrectly or get stuck. Additionally, random sampling may leave gaps with no coverage, and the method does not account for sequencing errors. As a result, the reconstruction is likely to be incomplete or inaccurate.
